The first step is to create a new custom menu, by heading to Appearance => Menus and following the guide.

Add the link for each social profile to your menu as a custom link. For example, http://twitter.com/catchthemes is our Twitter link.

* Google Plus
* Pinterest 
* GitHub
* Tumblr
* YouTube
* Flickr
* Vimeo
* Instagram
* LinkedIn
* Feed - add your feed URL

= Widgets =

Theme supports two widgets, one is your main one and second one is used for your homepage area and used as intro for your site. Please note that Intro Widget is available only if you are using default frontpage settings.

= Featured Images =

Before getting started with your featured images, regenerate them first and you can do that easily with this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/. The plugin allows you to regenerateyour thumbnails after changing the thumbnail sizes, which occurs by switching from one theme to another.
